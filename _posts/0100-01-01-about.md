At WalkDenver we believe that "people are pedestrians by design." Yet
street design is often focused solely on cars, resulting in streets that
are unsafe and unpleasant for people on foot.

WALKscope allows Denver residents and visitors to collect data related
to sidewalks, intersections, and pedestrian counts. This information will
help create an inventory of pedestrian infrastructure in Denver, identify
gaps, and build the case for improvements. WalkDenver and PlaceMatters
collaborated to develop WALKscope with grant funding from
[Mile High Connects](http://www.milehighconnects.org).
